# chicken-sadie
An adorable little app to remind you when to put the chickens to bed.

## usage
Run the app, and allow it to fetch some time information from the sunrise-sunset.org API.
Then either test the alarm (it will go off in 5 seconds), or set the alarm. Your phone will wake up at the recommended time
and remind you to close the chickens in for the night.

## build
This app should build with Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio with Xamarin spondoogles installed.
